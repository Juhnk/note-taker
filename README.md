# NoteTaker - Modern Note-Taking App

A simple, elegant note-taking application built with Swift and SwiftUI for iOS and macOS.

## Overview

NoteTaker is designed with maximum simplicity in mind:
- Rich text editing with formatting support
- Hierarchical folder organization
- Real-time cloud sync via CloudKit
- Search functionality
- Minimal, clean design
- Privacy-first approach

**Philosophy**: Build a reliable foundation first, add features incrementally.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Platforms**: iOS 17+, macOS 14+
- **Data**: Core Data with NSPersistentCloudKitContainer
- **Sync**: CloudKit (private database)
- **Design**: Minimal (white, greys, black)

### Why Core Data?

Core Data is battle-tested and production-ready:
- 15+ years of optimization and stability
- Superior performance at scale (10,000+ notes)
- Automatic CloudKit sync via NSPersistentCloudKitContainer
- All successful note apps use Core Data
- SwiftData is too immature (significant bugs in iOS 17 and iOS 18)

## Progress Tracking

Development is tracked in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) with:
- Checkbox-based task tracking
- 37 sprints across 3 phases (9 months)
- Estimated time and test coverage targets for each sprint
- Weekly progress updates
- Testing metrics

**Current Status**: See [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) Sprint 0.1

## Quality Standards

### No Code Without Tests
- Progressive coverage targets (40% → 70%)
- TDD approach (write tests first)
- Fast pre-commit hooks (~30 sec)
- CI/CD blocks untested PRs

### Development Cycles
- Maximum 2-3 days per cycle
- 1-3 features per cycle
- Each cycle includes: tests, docs, manual testing
- See [DEVELOPMENT_CYCLES.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_CYCLES.md)

### Code Quality Gates
1. **Pre-commit hook** (local, ~30 sec) - Fast syntax and style checks
2. **CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub) - Full validation, prevents bad merges
3. **Progressive coverage** (40% → 70%) - Practical quality improvement
4. **Progress tracking** (PROGRESS.md) - Maintains visibility

### Philosophy
- **"Maximum simplicity"** - Fast commits (~30 sec), not 6-16 minutes
- **Small cycles** - Multiple commits per day without pain
- **Quality enforced** - CI/CD blocks bad merges (not local commits)

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/description`
2. Make changes with conventional commits
3. Push and create Pull Request
4. Review and merge to main
5. Delete branch after merge

### Commit Convention
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

feat(editor): add bold formatting button
fix(sync): resolve duplicate note issue
docs: update ARCHITECTURE.md with Core Data setup
```

See [GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md](docs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md) for complete guidelines.

## Contributing

This is currently a personal project. The workflow and documentation are designed to support solo development with Claude Code assistance.

## Testing

**No code is complete without tests.**

### Testing Requirements

- **Progressive coverage targets** (see [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)):
  - Sprint 0: Disabled (empty project)
  - Sprint 1-2: 40% minimum
  - Sprint 3-5: 50% minimum
  - Sprint 6-9: 60% minimum
  - Sprint 10+: 70% minimum (final target)
- Unit tests for ViewModels and business logic (85% target)
- Integration tests for Core Data operations and sync (80% target)
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Manual testing on iOS and macOS
- Accessibility testing (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
- TestFlight beta before App Store release

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

We follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimum code to pass
3. Refactor if needed
4. Repeat

### Pre-Commit Hooks (FAST - ~30 seconds)

Pre-commit hooks run before every commit (~30 seconds) and block commits if:
- SwiftLint fails
- Debug print statements found (with confirmation)
- Syntax errors detected

**What's NOT in pre-commit** (runs in CI/CD instead):
- Full builds (too slow: 2-5 min each)
- Full test suites (too slow: 1-3 min each)
- Coverage checks (too slow: ~2 min)

Setup: `./scripts/setup-hooks.sh`

**Philosophy**: Fast feedback loop supports "maximum simplicity" and small 2-3 day cycles

### CI/CD Pipeline (COMPREHENSIVE)

GitHub Actions run on every PR and push to main (macOS-15, Xcode 16.4):
- ✅ SwiftLint (code quality)
- ✅ Build iOS and macOS (full builds)
- ✅ Run all tests (full test suites)
- ✅ Check progressive coverage targets
- ✅ Validate commit messages
- ✅ Check documentation updates

**Cannot merge without all checks passing.**

See [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for complete testing guidelines.

## Performance

Targets:
- Support 10,000+ notes without performance degradation
- Search results in < 100ms
- Sync 100 notes in < 10 seconds
- App launch in < 1 second

## Security & Privacy

- All data encrypted by CloudKit automatically
- No analytics or tracking
- No third-party services
- Private database only (user's iCloud)
- Export data anytime
- No account creation (uses Apple ID)

## License

TBD

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Planning complete, testing infrastructure ready, ready to create Xcode project

**Setup Steps**:
1. Run `./scripts/setup-hooks.sh` to install pre-commit hooks and SwiftLint
2. Create Xcode project with Core Data template (Sprint 0.1)
3. Set up Core Data entities (see ARCHITECTURE.md)
4. Implement PersistenceController with CloudKit
5. Build basic UI shell
6. Implement note CRUD operations

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- ✅ PROGRESS.md - Checkbox-based progress tracking
- ✅ Fast pre-commit hooks - Quick checks (~30 sec), no builds/tests
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline - Full validation, blocks bad merges
- ✅ Progressive coverage - 40% → 70% (practical approach)
- ✅ Testing guidelines - TDD approach, see TESTING.md
- ✅ Development cycles - 2-3 day maximum cycles

**Optimized for "maximum simplicity":**
- Pre-commit: ~30 seconds (was 6-16 minutes)
- CI/CD: Full validation without slowing local development
- Progressive coverage: Practical targets that increase over time

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Using Core Data instead of SwiftData (stability)
- CloudKit for sync (free, native, automatic)
- Minimal design (white, greys, black only)
- 9-month timeline (realistic based on research)
- iOS 17+ and macOS 14+ minimum versions
- TDD approach with progressive coverage (40% → 70%)
- Fast pre-commit (~30 sec), full CI/CD validation
- Small cycles (2-3 days max) to avoid AI overload
- macOS-15 runners, Xcode 16.4 (current as of Nov 2024-2025)
